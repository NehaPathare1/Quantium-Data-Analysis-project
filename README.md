# Overview
This project analyzes customer spending patterns and store sales performance for a retail business. It’s divided into two main tasks: understanding customer behavior and evaluating store performance through testing.

# Objectives
Find key customer groups and understand their spending habits.
Test if trial stores perform better than control stores to see if the trials are successful.

# Project Tasks

Task 1: Customer and Sales Analysis
Goal: To understand customer segments and what drives their purchases, helping improve sales strategy.

# Key Findings:

Top Spender Group: Mid-Age Singles/Couples (Mainstream) with an average spend of 7.65.
Spending Patterns: Mainstream customers spend more than Budget and Premium customers.
Opportunities in Premium: Retirees (Premium) have a lower average spend of 7.46. Promotions could help boost their spending.
Focus for Marketing: Mid-Age Singles/Couples (Mainstream) should be targeted with special offers to maximize sales.

# Additional Insights:

Most Items Bought: Older Families, especially in the Mainstream group, buy the most items on average (1.95).
Popular Brands: Top brands include Doritos and Smiths, with Dorito Corn Chips Supreme having the highest average sales (12.27).
Preferred Pack Sizes: Larger packs, like 380g (average sales of 11.75), are more popular, suggesting customers prefer buying in bulk.

Task 2: Testing Trial Store Success
Goal: To see if trial stores are performing better than the control stores.

# Findings:

Comparison with Controls: Control stores had an average sales of 7,074.74.
Successful Trials:
Store 86: Sales of 10,635.35 (Successful).
Store 88: Sales of 16,333.25 (Successful).
Store 77: Sales of 3,040.0 (Not successful).

# Recommendations:

Continue with stores 86 and 88 since they performed well.
Review strategy for store 77 to understand why it didn’t meet expectations.

# Summary of Results
I identified key customer groups who are valuable for sales growth, such as Mid-Age Singles/Couples (Mainstream).
Larger pack sizes and top brands like Doritos are preferred by customers.
The trial was successful for stores 86 and 88 but not for store 77, guiding future decisions.
