# Task Descriptions

Task 1: Customer and Transaction Analysis
Objective: To analyze transaction and customer data, identify trends and inconsistencies, and determine customer segments based on purchasing behavior. Key metrics were developed to assess sales drivers, providing insights for strategic decision-making.

# Analysis Findings:

Top Spender: MIDAGE SINGLES/COUPLES (Mainstream) lead with the highest average sales of 7.65, indicating they are the biggest spenders.
Spending Patterns: Mainstream customers generally outspend Budget and Premium customers across most life stages.
Premium Opportunity: RETIREES (Premium) have a lower average sale of 7.46, suggesting an opportunity for targeted promotions.
Marketing Focus: Recommend targeting MIDAGE SINGLES/COUPLES (Mainstream) with tailored strategies to further boost sales.

# Additional Insights:

Quantity Purchased by Segment: OLDER FAMILIES, especially in the Mainstream segment, have the highest average quantity purchased (1.95).
Brand Analysis: Dorito Corn Chips Supreme leads with an average sale of 12.27, followed by Smiths Crinkle Chips Original Big Bag at 11.25.
Pack Size Preferences: Larger pack sizes, particularly the 380g pack with an average sale of 11.75, are the top sellers, indicating a consumer preference for bulk purchases.

Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing
Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of trial stores by comparing their performance against control stores using uplift testing. The analysis assesses whether trial stores have achieved meaningful uplift in total sales.

# Analysis Findings:

Comparison Metrics: Total sales for each trial store were compared to the control storesâ€™ average sales of 7,074.74.
Trial Success:
Trial Store 86: Successful with a total sales of 10,635.35, surpassing the control average.
Trial Store 88: Successful with total sales of 16,333.25, significantly above the control average.

# Recommendations:

Continue trials for stores 86 and 88, as they outperformed control averages.
Reassess or adjust strategy for store 77, as it did not achieve the desired uplift.
